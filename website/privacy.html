            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 02, 2026</p>
            
            <p>MindControl ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>MindControl does not collect any personal data.</strong> The app operates entirely locally on your device. We do not have servers, and we do not transmit your data to any third party.</p>

            <h2>2. Sensitive Permissions</h2>
            <p>To provide its core functionality, MindControl requires the following permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accessibility Service:</strong> This is used solely to monitor which app is currently in the foreground. If the app is not on your "Allowed" list during a focus session, MindControl will block it to help you stay focused. We do not record, store, or transmit any data captured via this service.</li>
                <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> This allows you to select which apps you want to block or allow from the list of installed applications on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification Access:</strong> Used to display the persistent timer so you know how much focus time remains.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data remains on your device, the security of your data is tied to the security of your mobile device.</p>

            <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

            <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at support@mindcontrol.app (or your contact detail).</p>
